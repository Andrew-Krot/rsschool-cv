3. ### Summury:
     This is the first course I will take. Before that, I studied on video tutorials on YouTube. I can make a simple adaptive and        responsive landing page with minimal logic (slider, modal window). My goal is to become a front-end developer and I am sure this          course    will help me with this.
4. ### Skills: 
   * HTML5
   * CSS3
   * Bootstrap 4
   * BEM
   * Basic knowledge of Java Script
5. ### Code examples, experience:

   * [Unfinished project on React.js](https://github.com/Andrew-webdev/andrew-webdev.github.io/tree/master/my-app)
6. ### Education: 
   As I indicated above, this is my first course. Before that, I used open sources to get some basic knowledge.
7. ### English: 
   The result of the English test for training.by showed A1 level. But I continue to study it intensively every day and I am sure that        by the end of the course my level of English will meet at least the minimum requirements - A2 or higher.
